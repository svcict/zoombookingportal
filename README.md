# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

View your app in AI Studio: https://ai.studio/apps/a9af5e83-f90d-401a-a09f-0f01d1bc778b

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

## Zoom API Setup (Two Rotating Server-to-Server OAuth Accounts)

This portal creates real Zoom meetings via the [Zoom REST API](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/api/)
and rotates bookings across **two** Zoom accounts, so two overlapping meetings never hit a
single license's concurrent-meeting limit. Without any credentials configured, the app falls
back to local mock meeting data so it still runs for local development.

For each of the two Zoom accounts/licenses you want to rotate between, repeat these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/) as an account owner or
   admin of that Zoom account.
2. Go to **Develop > Build App**, choose **Server-to-Server OAuth**, and name it (e.g.
   "Booking Portal - Account A").
3. On the **Scopes** tab, add the granular scopes:
   - `meeting:write:meeting`
   - `meeting:read:meeting`
   - `meeting:update:meeting`
   - `meeting:delete:meeting`
   - `user:read:user`
4. Activate the app. Zoom shows you an **Account ID**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret** —
   copy all three.
5. Note the Zoom user (email or user ID) under that account that should host the meetings —
   this is the `USER_ID` value below.
6. Add the values to your `.env` file:
   ```
   ZOOM_ACCOUNT_A_ID=...
   ZOOM_ACCOUNT_A_CLIENT_ID=...
   ZOOM_ACCOUNT_A_CLIENT_SECRET=...
   ZOOM_ACCOUNT_A_USER_ID=host-a@yourcompany.com
   ZOOM_ACCOUNT_A_LABEL=Sales Team Zoom
   ```
7. Repeat for the second account using the `ZOOM_ACCOUNT_B_*` variables.

You can configure just one account (rotation is skipped and every meeting uses it) or both
(the server picks whichever account is free at the requested time slot, alternating when both
are free). Restart the server after editing `.env`, then use the **Zoom API Integration**
page's "Test API Ping" button to confirm both accounts authenticate successfully.
